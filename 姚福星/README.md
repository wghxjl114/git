## A desktop game controlled by arrow keys on your keyboard.
**********
Each time you can select one of the up, down, left and right directions to slide, each time you slide, all the digital squares will move closer to the sliding direction. The system will also display a number box in the blank space. The same number of squares are close together and collide. It will add up. Constantly stacking and finally figuring out the number of 2048 is a success.
